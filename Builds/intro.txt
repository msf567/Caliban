Will

	If you are reading this, I am truly sorry. This time it is true.
	If you are reading this, I must have done something right.

	
	I have not slept, all I can think about is what I did to you.
	The pain I caused.
	
	From my core I never meant to hurt you or to drive you away.
	I just needed to protect myself.
	
	
	Please Will, accept my apology. This time it is true.
	
	Please, will you let me go?
